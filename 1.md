#Chapter 1: A Tour of Computer Systems
##1.1 Information Is Bits + Context
The source program is a sequence of bits, each with a value of 0 or 1ï¼Œ organized in 8-bit chunks called bytes. Each byte represents some text character in the program.

Files such as hello.c that consist exclusively of ASCII characters are known as text files. All other files are known as binary files.

##1.2 Programs Are Translated by Other Programs into Different Forms
| hello.c | | hello.i | | hello.s | | hello.o | | hello | 
| ------- |-| ------- |-| ------- |-| ------- |-|-------|
| Source | Preprocessor | Modified Source | Compiler | Assembly | Assembler | Relocatable object programs | Executable | Executable object |

+ Preprocessor Phase
Read stdio.h and insert it directly
+ Compilation phase
```c
1 main:
2 subq $8, %rsp
3 movl $.LCO, %edi
4 call puts
5 movl $0, %eax
6 addq $8, %rsp
7 ret
```
+ Assembly Phase
Convert to a 17 byte relocatble object program
+ Linking phase
Merge printf.o and hello.o

##1.3 It Pays to Understand How Compilation Systems Work
+ Optimizing program performance
+ Understanding link-time errors
+ Avoiding security holes

##1.4 Processors Read and Interpret Instructions Stored in Meomory
###1.4.1 Hardware Organization of a System
+ **Buses**
Os based byte-sized word: 4 bytes or 8 bytes
+ **I/O Device**
Contrallers(chip sets on motherboard) and Adaptors(plugged-in card)
+ **Main Memory** 
Physically, main memory consists of a collection of dynamic random access memory(DRAM) chips. Logically, memory is organized as a linear array of bytes, each with its own unique address (array index) starting at zero. 
short: 2 bytes
int and float: 4 bytes
long and double: 8 bytes
+ **Processor**
PC: A word-size storage device
Register file: small deice that consists of a collection of word-size registers
Simple operations: 
   + Load(mem => reg)
   + Save(reg => mem)
   + Operate (2 regs => ALU => reg)
   + Junp (extract a word into the PC)

  Instruction Set Architecture vs Microarchitecture

###1.4.2 Running the ==hello== Program
1. Keyboard "Hello" => Register file => Main Memory
2. (Direct Memory Access) Disk "Object file" => Memory
3. After loaded hello object file, run the instructions which will copy "Hello World" string from memory to the register file and then to the display device.

##1.5 Caches Matter
1. Waste of Copy: 
loaded program to memory then copy to processor 
copy "Hello world" to memory then to display device
2. Cache
To deal with processor-memory gap
